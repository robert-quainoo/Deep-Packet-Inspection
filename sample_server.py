# This program is a sample server for the socket programming assignment. It generates a set of    #
# simple mathematical expressions as strings, which are sent via TCP to the client. The client    #
# needs to send back the correct answer for each of the operations. When enough correct results   #
# have been received, a secret flag is generated and sent back to the client. Finally, the        #
# connection is closed, and the server proceeds to shut down.                                     #
#                                                                                                 #
# This program was initially authored by Carlos Bocanegra <bocanegrac@coe.neu.edu>.               #
# It has since been edited by Kevin Hines <hines.ke@husky.neu.edu> and Abhimanyu Venkatraman      #
